# Fraudulent or Legitimate? 
<h3>In this project a Random Forest supervised model is trained to classify transactions into fraudulent and legitimate using a Kaggle dataset</h3>
</br>• The dataset is highly imbalanced therefore several resampling techniques were employed to train an unbiased model and get the best performance 
</br>• Some feature selection methods were applied and compared to choose the optimal number of features as the dataset itself is huge
</br>• The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection
