# transaction_classification 
In this project a Random Forest supervised model is trained to classify transactions into fraudulent and legitimate using a Kaggle dataset
• The dataset is highly imbalanced therefore several resampling techniques were employed to train an unbiased model and get the best performance 
• Some feature selection methods were applied and compared to choose the optimal number of features as the dataset itself is huge
• The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection
